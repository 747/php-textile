Extending Textile
=================

You can add your own block handers to textile by writing php implementations 
and making your files available in the 'textplugs-enabled' directory (or 
where-ever you have defined the directory to be.)

The distribution has some example textplugs in the 'textplugs-available' 
directory. You don't have to use any of these textplugs but you can if you want.


Enabling textplug extensions
----------------------------

To enable a textplug, either...

  * Copy it, preserving the filename, to the 'textplugs-enabled' directory 

	--or--

	* Create a symlink in 'textplugs-enabled' with exactly the same name as the 
	  source file.


Naming your textplug files
--------------------------

If you write a new textplug then your file name must follow a string filename 
convention.

{plugname}.textplug.php

Where {plugname} is definable by the textplug author but, in the case of 
block-level textplugs, this should match the name of the block being added.

The php file is included just once and should call Textile::RegisterBlockHandler() 
to get the handler(s) they implement registered with Textile.
