Extending Textile
=================

Textile can be extended through the use of textile-plugins called *textplugs*.

You can add your own textplugs to textile by writing php implementations 
and making your files available in the 'textplugs-enabled' directory or 
where-ever you define the directory to be in the 'txt_plugin_directory' define.

We recommend having classTextile.php and it's support directories outside of your 
site root folder if at all possible.

The standard distribution has some example textplugs in the 'textplugs-available' 
directory. You don't have to use any of these textplugs but you can if you want.

|-- textplugs-available                 (holds officially maintained textplugs)
            |-- external             (holds non-maintained, example, textplugs)


Enabling textplugs
------------------

To enable a textplug, either...

  * Copy it, preserving the filename, to the 'textplugs-enabled' directory 

	--or--

  * Create a symlink to it in 'textplugs-enabled' with exactly the same name as 
    the source file.

If you change the txt_plugin_directory define from the default location use 
your prefered location for the copy-or-link actions.


Naming your textplug files
--------------------------

If you write a new textplug then your file name must follow a string filename 
convention.

{plugname}.textplug.php

Where {plugname} is definable by the textplug author but, in the case of 
block-level textplugs, this should match the name of the block being added.

The php file is included just once and should call Textile::RegisterBlockHandler() 
to get the handler(s) they implement registered with Textile.
