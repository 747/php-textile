h2. Using Composer

The recommended way to install PHP-Textile is via "Composer":https://getcomposer.org/ package manager. Navigate to your project directory, and run the command:

bc(language-sh). $ composer require "netcarver/textile {{ site.php_textile_version_minor }}.*"

The above uses the "require":http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require command to install the latest stable version of "PHP-Textile":https://packagist.org/packages/netcarver/textile as listed on "Packagist":https://packagist.org/. To update your old PHP-Textile installation run "update":http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#update command instead.

h2. Manual

You can also ==<a href="{{ site.github_url }}/archive/v{{ site.php_textile_version_latest }}.zip"><i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> download PHP-Textile as a ZIP archive</a>==, extract it and place the included @src@ directory somewhere to your project tree. You can even do this with a single command liner if you so wish:

bc(language-sh). $ curl -L "{{ site.github_url }}/archive/v{{ site.php_textile_version_latest }}.tar.gz" | tar -zx

The above uses cURL to download the latest TAR and extracts it with tar.
