PHP-Textile library requires:

* PHP 5.3.0 or newer.
* "Ctype":http://php.net/manual/en/book.ctype.php extension.

Optional, but highly recommended:

* "Mbstring":http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php extension.
* PCRE compiled with UTF-8 support.

With out these optional components, PHP-Textile will not be able to process non-ASCII input properly.
